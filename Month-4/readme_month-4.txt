We embarked on our exploration by delving into both BERT Small and BERT Large models to assess their efficacy for our task. Unfortunately, our initial trials with BERT
Small didn't yield the desired outcomes. Recognizing this, we shifted our attention to BERT Large, considering its potential for more robust performance.

Subsequently, we undertook modifications to the model and proceeded to train it using the AnthropiC-RLHF dataset, a corpus renowned for its balanced conversations
between human users and assistants. This training process allowed the model to adapt to the nuances of biased and unbiased responses within these conversations, thereby
enhancing its understanding and predictive capabilities.

As part of our quest for further optimization, we engaged in fine-tuning the model with another dataset known as Synthetic-Instruct-GPTJ-Pairwise. This additional fine
tuning step involved exposing the model to a different set of linguistic patterns and contexts, thereby broadening its scope of comprehension and improving its
performance across various scenarios.

Through these iterative steps of modification, training, and fine-tuning, we succeeded in significantly bolstering the model's performance, achieving a level of
proficiency that surpassed our earlier endeavors and laid a solid foundation for future advancements in natural language processing tasks.
